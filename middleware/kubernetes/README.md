# kubernetes

*kubernetes* enables reading zone data from a kubernetes cluster.
It implements the [spec](https://github.com/kubernetes/dns/blob/master/docs/specification.md)
defined for kubernetes DNS-Based service discovery:

Service `A` records are constructed as "myservice.mynamespace.svc.coredns.local" where:

* "myservice" is the name of the k8s service
* "mynamespace" is the k8s namespace for the service, and
* "svc" indicates this is a service
* "coredns.local" is the zone

Pod `A` records are constructed as "1-2-3-4.mynamespace.pod.coredns.local" where:

* "1-2-3-4" is derived from the ip address of the pod (1.2.3.4 in this example)
* "mynamespace" is the k8s namespace for the service, and
* "pod" indicates this is a pod
* "coredns.local" is the zone

Endpoint `A` records are constructed as "epname.myservice.mynamespace.svc.coredns.local" where:

* "epname" is the hostname (or name constructed from IP) of the endpoint
* "myservice" is the name of the k8s service that the endpoint serves
* "mynamespace" is the k8s namespace for the service, and
* "svc" indicates this is a service
* "coredns.local" is the zone

Also supported are PTR and SRV records for services/endpoints.

## Syntax

This is an example kubernetes configuration block, with all options described:

```
# kubernetes <zone> [<zone>] ...
#
# Use kubernetes middleware for domain "coredns.local"
# Reverse domain zones can be defined here (e.g. 0.0.10.in-addr.arpa),
# or instead with the "cidrs" option.
#
kubernetes coredns.local {

	# resyncperiod <period>
	#
	# Kubernetes data API resync period. Default is 5m
	# Example values: 60s, 5m, 1h
	#
	resyncperiod 5m

	# endpoint <url>
	#
	# Use url for a remote k8s API endpoint.  If omitted, it will connect to
	# k8s in-cluster using the cluster service account.
	#
	endpoint https://k8s-endpoint:8080

	# tls <cert-filename> <key-filename> <cacert-filename>
	#
	# The tls cert, key and the CA cert filenanames for remote k8s connection.
	# This option is ignored if connecting in-cluster (i.e. endpoint is not
	# specified).
	#
	tls cert key cacert

	# namespaces <namespace> [<namespace>] ...
	#
	# Only expose the k8s namespaces listed.  If this option is omitted
	# all namespaces are exposed
	#
	namespaces demo

	# lables <expression> [,<expression>] ...
	#
	# Only expose the records for kubernetes objects
	# that match this label selector. The label
	# selector syntax is described in the kubernetes
	# API documentation: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels/
	# Example selector below only exposes objects tagged as
	# "application=nginx" in the staging or qa environments.
	#
	labels environment in (staging, qa),application=nginx

	# pods <disabled|insecure|verified>
	#
	# Set the mode of responding to pod A record requests.
	# e.g 1-2-3-4.ns.pod.zone.  This option is provided to allow use of
	# SSL certs when connecting directly to pods.
	# Valid values: disabled, verified, insecure
	#  disabled: Do not process pod requests, always returning NXDOMAIN
	#  insecure: Always return an A record with IP from request (without
	#            checking k8s).  This option is is vulnerable to abuse if
	#            used maliciously in conjuction with wildcard SSL certs.
	#  verified: Return an A record if there exists a pod in same
	#            namespace with matching IP.  This option requires
	#            substantially more memory than in insecure mode, since it
	#            will maintain a watch on all pods.
	# Default value is "disabled".
	#
	pods disabled

	# cidrs <cidr> [<cidr>] ...
	#
	# Expose cidr ranges to reverse lookups.  Include any number of space
	# delimited cidrs, and or multiple cidrs options on separate lines.
	# kubernetes middleware will respond to PTR requests for ip addresses
	# that fall within these ranges.
	#
	cidrs 10.0.0.0/24 10.0.10.0/25

}

```

## Wildcards

Some query labels accept a wildcard value to match any value.
If a label is a valid wildcard (\*, or the word "any"), then that label will match
all values.  The labels that accept wildcards are:
* _service_ in an `A` record request: _service_.namespace.svc.zone.
   * e.g. `*.ns.svc.myzone.local`
* _namespace_ in an `A` record request: service._namespace_.svc.zone.
   * e.g. `nginx.*.svc.myzone.local`
* _port and/or protocol_ in an `SRV` request: __port_.__protocol_.service.namespace.svc.zone.
   * e.g. `_http.*.service.ns.svc.`
* multiple wild cards are allowed in a single query.
   * e.g. `A` Request `*.*.svc.zone.` or `SRV` request `*.*.*.*.svc.zone.`
